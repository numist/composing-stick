/* 
Pax browsing supports the following:
(1) 	/category/page/3/ loads the third page of results from that category
(2) 	/category/pages/3/ loads 3 pages of results, including page 3, from the beginning
			/category/pages/1-3/ does the same as previous, except page 1 is explicit
			/category/pages/2-3/ loads 2 pages of results, including page 3, excluding page 1

Why is this necessary?

We don't want to break the back button. 
(1) 	User loads /all/page/1/
(2) 	Scrolling dynamically adds the contents of /all/page/2/ to the page
 			At the same time, the history is updated to reflect the state of the page.
			That's where the pageS capability comes in.
(3a)	As long as we started on page 1, we can just update history to /all/pages/2/
			That way, when the user hits the back button, /all/pages/2/ will be loaded.
(3b)	What if the user started at page /all/page/2/ ?
			The user scrolls, and the page dynamically updates with contents of /all/page/3/
			The history is updated to reflect the state of the page.
			PROBLEM! The history no longer reflects the state of the page.
			The history says the current page is /all/pages/3/, but we started browsing at /all/page/2/.
			You see where this is going?
			This is a problem, because when the user hits the back button, they'll end up at an unfamiliar place
			on the resulting page because /all/pages/3/ loads 3 pages, including page 1. But we started at page 2.
(4)		Instead of simply asking for the number of pages loaded, we also explicitly request the start of page range.
			So, in (3b), user begins at /all/page/2/
			Scrolling results in dynamic load of /all/page/3/, and history is updated to reflect the state:
			History becomes /all/pages/2-3/.
			User scrolls more, resulting in dynamic load of /all/page/4/, history is updated to reflect the state:
			History becomes /all/pages/2-4/.

That unchanging value (2 in the example above) is the page base we must hang onto through 
dynamic loads and history state updates.
Hence the variable below.
Phew.
